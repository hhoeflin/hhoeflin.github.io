# Introduction

My name in Holger Hoefling and I am a Statistician, Machine Learner
and Bioinformatician. For the last 10 years I have worked for Novartis
in various roles, currently as the Lead of the machine learning
group in Data Science, NX, NIBR.

In my career I have worked on a wide range of data science
problems in the healthcare field. This experience spans
from working on clinical study protocols, the development
of predictive algorithms for kidney disease to the
statistical analysis of experiments in early non-clinical
research with microarray, NGS and other biomarker data.

More recently I have been the leader of a team of
machine learners working on applications in cheminformatics
as well deep learning on histopathology images and other
imaging applications.
